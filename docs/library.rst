Python Library
==============

The QuAACS project includes a Python library that can be used to interact with
YAML and SQLite QuAACS objects.

Versioning
----------

The Python library uses semantic versioning and the major and minor versions will always be versioned to match the QuAACS version it
will process. The patch version will be incremented for bug fixes and minor changes.
E.g. QuAACS specification 1.0.0 will be processed by the Python library 1.0.x versions.
